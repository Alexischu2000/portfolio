<h2 style="font-size:200%;font-family: 'Amatic SC', cursive;"> Get to know me</h2>
<p style="font-size:140%;font-family: 'Bubbler One', sans-serif;"> My name is Alexis and I live in Burlingame, California. I am a senior at Burlingame high school. I love to travel with my family and visit new places all over the world! In addition to travel, I love to play music! I play the clarinet and I am apart of the high school band, marching band, and the pit for school musicals. Since band has taken up most of my time, I have made so many amazing friends because of it! </p>
